# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a buildathon project (buildathon-project4) - a one-day rapid prototyping competition for innovative AI solutions. The repository is currently minimal with only a README and Python-based .gitignore configuration.

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Python (inferred from .gitignore patterns)
- **Project Type**: AI solution prototype for buildathon competition

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with:
- Basic README.md describing the buildathon project
- Python-focused .gitignore with patterns for common Python tools (pytest, coverage, environments, packaging tools)
- No source code, dependencies, or configuration files yet

## Development Setup

Since this is a fresh Python project, typical setup would involve:
- Creating a virtual environment
- Installing dependencies when requirements.txt or pyproject.toml is added
- Following Python best practices for the AI solution being prototyped

## Architecture Notes

This is a blank slate project ready for rapid prototyping. The specific architecture will depend on the AI solution being developed during the buildathon.
